Chris Wallace:
Good evening from the Health Education Campus of Case Western Reserve University and the Cleveland Clinic. I'm Chris Wallace of Fox News and I welcome you to the first of the 2020 Presidential Debates between President Donald J. Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden. This debate is sponsored by the Commission on Presidential debates. The Commission has designed the format, six roughly 15 minute segments with two minute answers from each candidate to the first question, then open discussion for the rest of each segment. Both campaigns have agreed to these rules. For the record, I decided the topics and the questions in each topic. I can assure you none of the questions has been shared with the Commission or the two candidates.

Chris Wallace:
This debate is being conducted under health and safety protocols designed by the Cleveland Clinic, which is serving as the Health Security advisor to the Commission for all four debates. As a precaution, both campaigns have agreed the candidates will not shake hands at the beginning of tonight's debate. The audience here in the hall has promised to remain silent. No cheers, no boos, or other interruptions so we, and more importantly you, can focus on what the candidates have to say. No noise except right now, as we welcome the Republican nominee, President Trump, and the Democratic nominee Vice President Biden.

Vice President Joe Biden:
How you doing, man?

President Donald J. Trump:
How are you doing?

Vice President Joe Biden:
I'm well.

Chris Wallace:
Gentlemen, a lot of people been waiting for this night, so let's get going. Our first subject is the Supreme Court. President Trump, you nominated Amy Coney Barrett over the weekend to succeed the late Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the Court. You say the Constitution is clear about your obligation and the Senate's to consider a nominee to the Court. Vice President Biden, you say that this is an effort by the President and Republicans to jam through on an appointment in what you call an abuse of power. My first question to both of you tonight, why are you right in the argument you make and your opponent wrong? And where do you think a Justice Barrett would take the court? President Trump, in this first segment, you go first. Two minutes.

President Donald J. Trump:
Thank you very much, Chris. I will tell you very simply. We won the election. Elections have consequences. We have the Senate, we have the White House, and we have a phenomenal nominee respected by all. Top, top academic, good in every way. Good in every way. In fact, some of her biggest endorsers are very liberal people from Notre Dame and other places. So I think she's going to be fantastic. We have plenty of time. Even if we did it after the election itself. I have a lot of time after the election, as you know. So I think that she will be outstanding. She's going to be as good as anybody that has served on that court. We really feel that. We have a professor at Notre Dame, highly respected by all, said she's the single greatest student he's ever had. He's been a professor for a long time at a great school.

President Donald J. Trump:
And we won the election and therefore we have the right to choose her, and very few people knowingly would say otherwise. And by the way, the Democrats, they wouldn't even think about not doing it. The only difference is they'd try and do it faster. There's no way they would give it up. They had Merrick Garland, but the problem is they didn't have the election so they were stopped. And probably that would happen in reverse, also. Definitely would happen in reverse. So we won the election and we have the right to do it, Chris.

Chris Wallace:
President Trump, thank you. Same question to you, Vice President Biden. You have two minutes.

Vice President Joe Biden:
Well, first of all, thank you for doing this and looking forward to this, Mr. President.

President Donald J. Trump:
Thank you, Joe.

Vice President Joe Biden:
The American people have a right to have a say in who the Supreme Court nominee is and that say occurs when they vote for United States Senators and when they vote for the President of United States. They're not going to get that chance now because we're in the middle of an election already. The election has already started. Tens of thousands of people already voted and so the thing that should happen is we should wait. We should wait and see what the outcome of this election is because that's the only way the American people get to express their view is by who they elect as President and who they elect as Vice President.

Vice President Joe Biden:
Now, what's at stake here is the President's made it clear, he wants to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. He's been running on that, he ran on that and he's been governing on that. He's in the Supreme Court right now trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, which will strip 20 million people from having health insurance now, if it goes into court. And the justice, I'm not opposed to the justice, she seems like a very fine person. But she's written, before she went in the bench, which is her right, that she thinks that the Affordable Care Act is not Constitutional. The other thing that's on the court, and if it's struck down, what happens? Women's rights are fundamentally changed. Once again, a woman could pay more money because she has a pre-existing condition of pregnancy. They're able to charge women more for the same exact procedure a man gets.

Vice President Joe Biden:
And that ended when we, in fact, passed the Affordable Care Act, and there's a hundred million people who have pre-existing conditions and they'll be taken away as well. Those pre-existing conditions, insurance companies are going to love this. And so it's just not appropriate to do this before this election. If he wins the election and the Senate is Republican, then he goes forward. If not, we should wait until February.

President Donald J. Trump:
There aren't a hundred million people with pre-existing conditions. As far as a say is concerned, the people already had their say. Okay, Justice Ginsburg said very powerfully, very strongly, at some point 10 years ago or so, she said a President and the Senate is elected for a period of time, but a President is elected for four years. We're not elected for three years. I'm not elected for three years. So we have the Senate, we have a President-

Vice President Joe Biden:
He's elected to the next election.

President Donald J. Trump:
During that period of time, during that period of time, we have an opening. I'm not elected for three years. I'm elected for four years. Joe, the hundred million people is totally wrong. I don't know where you got that number. The bigger problem that you have is that you're going to extinguish 180 million people with their private health care, that they're very happy this.

Vice President Joe Biden:
That's simply not true.

President Donald J. Trump:
Well, you're certainly going to socialist. You're going to socialist-

Chris Wallace:
Gentlemen, we're now into open discussion.

Vice President Joe Biden:
Open discussion.

Chris Wallace:
Open discussion, yes, I agree. Go ahead, Vice President.

Vice President Joe Biden:
Number one, he knows what I proposed. What I proposed is that we expand Obamacare and we increase it. We do not wipe any. And one of the big debates we had with 23 of my colleagues trying to win the nomination that I won, were saying that Biden wanted to allow people to have private insurance still. They can. They do. They will under my proposal.

President Donald J. Trump:
That's not what you've said and it's not what your party is saying.

Vice President Joe Biden:
That is simply a lie.

President Donald J. Trump:
Your party doesn't say it. Your party wants to go socialist medicine and socialist healthcare.

Vice President Joe Biden:
The party is me. Right now, I am the Democratic Party.

President Donald J. Trump:
And they're going to dominate you, Joe. You know that.

Vice President Joe Biden:
I am the Democratic Party right now.

President Donald J. Trump:
Not according to Harris.

Vice President Joe Biden:
The platform of the Democratic Party is what I, in fact, approved of, what I approved of. Now, here's the deal. The deal is that it's going to wipe out pre-existing conditions. And, by the way, the 200,000 people that have died on his watch, how many of those have survived? Well, there's seven million people that contracted COVID. What does it mean for them going forward if you strike down the Affordable Care Act?

President Donald J. Trump:
Joe, you've had 308,000 military people dying because you couldn't provide them proper healthcare in the military. So don't tell me about this.

Vice President Joe Biden:
I'm happy to talk about this.

President Donald J. Trump:
And if you were here, it wouldn't be 200, it would be two million people because you were very late on the draw. You didn't want me to ban China, which was heavily infected. You didn't want me to ban Europe.

Chris Wallace:
All right, gentlemen, Mr. President.

President Donald J. Trump:
You would have been much later, Joe, much later.

Chris Wallace:
Mr. President.

President Donald J. Trump:
We're talking about two million people.

Vice President Joe Biden:
You're not going to be able to shut him up.

Chris Wallace:
Mr. President, as the moderator, we are going to talk about COVID in the next segment. But go ahead.

Vice President Joe Biden:
Let me finish. The point is that the President also is opposed to Roe V. Wade. That's on the ballot as well and the court, in the court, and so that's also at stake right now. And so the election is all-

President Donald J. Trump:
You don't know what's on the ballot. Why is it on the ballot? Why is it on the ballot? It's not on the ballot.

Vice President Joe Biden:
It's on the ballot in the court.

President Donald J. Trump:
I don't think so.

Vice President Joe Biden:
In the court.

President Donald J. Trump:
There's nothing happening there.

Vice President Joe Biden:
Donald would you just be quiet for a minute.

President Donald J. Trump:
You don't know her view on Roe V. Wade? You don't know here view.

Chris Wallace:
Well, all right. All right. Let's talk. We've got a lot to unpack here, gentlemen. We've got a lot of time. On healthcare, and then we'll come back to Roe V. Wade.

Vice President Joe Biden:
All right.

Chris Wallace:
Mr. President, the Supreme Court will hear a case a week after the election in which the Trump Administration, along with 18 state Attorney Generals are seeking to overturn Obamacare, to end Obamacare.

President Donald J. Trump:
That's right.

Chris Wallace:
You have spent the last week-

President Donald J. Trump:
Because they want to give good healthcare.

Chris Wallace:
If I may ask my question, sir.

Vice President Joe Biden:
Good healthcare.

Chris Wallace:
Over the last four years, you have promised to repeal and replace Obamacare, but you have never in these four years come up with a plan, a comprehensive plan, to replace Obamacare.

President Donald J. Trump:
Yes, I have. Of course, I have. The individual mandate.

Chris Wallace:
[crosstalk] when I finish I'm going to give an opportunity-

President Donald J. Trump:
Excuse me. I got rid of the individual mandate, which was a big chunk of Obamacare.

Chris Wallace:
That's not a comprehensive place.

President Donald J. Trump:
That is absolutely a big thing. That was the worst part of Obamacare.

Chris Wallace:
I didn't ask, sir.

President Donald J. Trump:
Chris, that was the worst part of Obamacare.

Chris Wallace:
You're debating him not me. Let me ask my question.

President Donald J. Trump:
Well, I'll ask Joe. The individual mandate was the most unpopular aspect of Obamacare.

Chris Wallace:
Mr. President.

President Donald J. Trump:
I got rid of it. And we will protect people.

Chris Wallace:
Mr. President, I'm the moderator of this debate and I would like you to let me ask my question and then you can answer.

President Donald J. Trump:
Go ahead.

Chris Wallace:
You, in the course of these four years, have never come up with a comprehensive plan to replace Obamacare, and just this last Thursday you signed a largely symbolic Executive Order to protect people with pre-existing conditions five days before this debate. So my question, sir, is what is the Trump healthcare plan?

President Donald J. Trump:
Well, first of all, I guess I'm debating you, not him, but that's okay. I'm not surprised. Let me just tell you something. There's nothing symbolic. I'm cutting drug prices. I'm going with Favored Nations, which no President has the courage to do because you're going against big pharma. Drug prices will be coming down 80 or 90%. You could have done it during your 47 year period in government, but you didn't do it. Nobody's done it. So we're cutting healthcare.

Chris Wallace:
What about pre-existing conditions?

President Donald J. Trump:
All of the things that we've done.

Vice President Joe Biden:
He has not done healthcare.

President Donald J. Trump:
I'll give you an example. Insulin, it was destroying families, destroying people, the cost. I'm getting it for so cheap it's like water, you want to know the truth. So cheap. Take a look at all of the drugs that what we're doing. Prescription drug prices, we're going to allow our Governors now to go to other countries to buy drugs because when they paid just a tiny fraction of what we do.

Chris Wallace:
Okay, like I say, this is open discussion.

President Donald J. Trump:
This is big stuff.

Chris Wallace:
Sir, you'll be happy. I'm about to pick up on one of your points to ask the Vice President, which is, he points out that you would like to add a public option to Obamacare.

Vice President Joe Biden:
Yes.

Chris Wallace:
And the argument that he makes and other Republicans make is that that is going to end private insurance.

Vice President Joe Biden:
It is not.

Chris Wallace:
If I start asking the question.

President Donald J. Trump:
That's not what your party says, by the way.

Chris Wallace:
And it will end private insurance and create a government takeover of health.

Vice President Joe Biden:
It does not. It's only for those people who are so poor they qualify for Medicaid they can get that free in most States, except Governors who want to deny people who are poor Medicaid. Anyone who qualifies for Medicaid would automatically be enrolled in the public option. The vast majority of the American people would still not be in that option. Number one. Number two.

President Donald J. Trump:
Joe, you agreed with Bernie Sanders, who's far left, on the manifesto, we call it. And that gives you socialized medicine.

Vice President Joe Biden:
Look, hey.

President Donald J. Trump:
Are you saying you didn't agree?

Vice President Joe Biden:
I'm not going to listen to him. The fact of the matter is I beat Bernie Sanders.

President Donald J. Trump:
Not by much.

Vice President Joe Biden:
I beat him by a whole hell of a lot.

President Donald J. Trump:
Not by much.

Vice President Joe Biden:
I'm here standing facing you, old buddy.

President Donald J. Trump:
If Pocahontas would have left two days early you would have lost every primary.

Vice President Joe Biden:
All he knows how to do-

President Donald J. Trump:
On Super Tuesday, you got very lucky.

Vice President Joe Biden:
Look he's the deal. I got very lucky. I'm going to get very lucky tonight as well.

President Donald J. Trump:
With what?

Vice President Joe Biden:
And tonight I'm going to make sure.

President Donald J. Trump:
With what?

Vice President Joe Biden:
Because here's the deal, here's the deal. The fact is that everything he's saying so far is simply a lie. I'm not here to call out his lies. Everybody knows he's a liar.

President Donald J. Trump:
But you agree. Joe, you're the liar. You graduated last in your class not first in your class.

Vice President Joe Biden:
God, I want to make sure-

Chris Wallace:
Mr. President, can you let him finish, sir?

Vice President Joe Biden:
No, he doesn't know how to do that.

President Donald J. Trump:
You'd be surprised. You'd be surprised. Go ahead, Joe.

Vice President Joe Biden:
The wrong guy, the wrong night, at the wrong time.

President Donald J. Trump:
Listen, you agreed with Bernie Sanders and the manifesto.

Vice President Joe Biden:
There is no manifesto, number one.

Chris Wallace:
Please let him speak, Mr. President.

Vice President Joe Biden:
Number two.

President Donald J. Trump:
He just lost the left.

Vice President Joe Biden:
Number two.

President Donald J. Trump:
You just lost the left. You agreed with Bernie Sanders on a plan that you absolutely agreed to and under that plan [crosstalk 00:15:10], they call it socialized medicine.

Chris Wallace:
Mr. President.

Vice President Joe Biden:
I'll tell you what, he is not for any help for people needing healthcare.

President Donald J. Trump:
Who is, Bernie?

Vice President Joe Biden:
Because he, in fact, already has costs 10 million people their healthcare that they had from their employers because of his recession. Number one. Number two, there are 20 million people getting healthcare through Obamacare now that he wants to take it away. He won't ever look you in the eye and say that's what he wants to do. Take it away.

President Donald J. Trump:
No, I want to give them better healthcare at a much lower price, because Obamacare is no good.

Vice President Joe Biden:
He doesn't know how. He doesn't know how to do that.

President Donald J. Trump:
I've already fixed it.

Vice President Joe Biden:
He has never offered a plan.

President Donald J. Trump:
We've already fixed it to an extent. Obamacare, as you might know but probably don't, Obamacare is no good.

Chris Wallace:
Gentlemen, you realize if you're both speaking at the same time. Let the President. Go ahead, sir.

President Donald J. Trump:
Obamacare is no good. We made it better and I had a choice to make very early on. We took away the individual mandate. We guaranteed pre-existing conditions, but took away the individual mandate. Listen, this is the way it is. And that destroyed ... They shouldn't even call it Obamacare, then I had a choice to make, do I let my people run it really well or badly? If I run it badly, they'll probably blame him, but they'll blame me. But more importantly, I want to help people. Okay. I said, "You've got to run it so well." And I just had a meeting with them. They said the problem is, no matter how well you run Obamacare, it's a disaster. It's too expensive. Premiums are too high, that it doesn't work. So we do want to get rid of it. Chris, we want to get rid of that and give something that's cheaper and better.

Chris Wallace:
I understand that, sir. But I have to give you roughly equal time.

President Donald J. Trump:
Go ahead.

Chris Wallace:
Please let the Vice President talk, sir.

President Donald J. Trump:
Good.

Vice President Joe Biden:
He has no plan for healthcare.

President Donald J. Trump:
Of course, we do.

Chris Wallace:
Please.

Vice President Joe Biden:
He sends out wishful thinking. He has Executive Orders that have no power. He hasn't lowered drug costs for anybody. He's been promising a healthcare plan since he got elected. He has none, like almost everything else he talks about. He does not have a plan. He doesn't have a plan. And the fact is this man doesn't know what he's talking about. [crosstalk 00:17:14].

Chris Wallace:
All right, I have one final question for you.

Vice President Joe Biden:
Sure.

Chris Wallace:
Mr. Vice President, if Senate Republicans, we were talking originally about the Supreme Court here, if Senate Republicans go ahead and confirm Justice Barrett there has been talk about ending the filibuster or even packing the court, adding to the nine justices there. You call this a distraction by the President. But, in fact, it wasn't brought up by the President. It was brought up by some of your Democratic colleagues in the Congress. So my question to you is, you have refused in the past to talk about it, are you willing to tell the American tonight whether or not you will support either ending the filibuster or packing the court?

Vice President Joe Biden:
Whatever position I take on that, that'll become the issue. The issue is the American people should speak. You should go out and vote. You're voting now. Vote and let your Senators know strongly how you feel.

President Donald J. Trump:
Are you going to pack the court?

Vice President Joe Biden:
Vote now.

President Donald J. Trump:
Are you going to pack the court?

Vice President Joe Biden:
Make sure you, in fact, let people know, your Senators.

President Donald J. Trump:
He doesn't want to answer the question.

Vice President Joe Biden:
I'm not going to answer the question.

President Donald J. Trump:
Why wouldn't you answer that question? You want to put a lot of new Supreme Court Justices. Radical left.

Vice President Joe Biden:
Will you shut up, man?

President Donald J. Trump:
Listen, who is on your list, Joe? Who's on your list?

Chris Wallace:
Gentlemen, I think we've ended this-

Vice President Joe Biden:
This is so un-Presidential.

President Donald J. Trump:
He's going to pack the court. He is not going to give a list.

Chris Wallace:
We have ended the segment. We're going to move on to the second segment.

Vice President Joe Biden:
That was really a productive segment, wasn't it? Keep yapping, man.

President Donald J. Trump:
The people understand, Joe.

Vice President Joe Biden:
They sure do.

President Donald J. Trump:
47 years, you've done nothing. They're understand.

Chris Wallace:
All right, the second subject is COVID-19, which is an awfully serious subject. So let's try to be serious about it. We have had more than seven million cases of coronavirus in the United States and more than 200,000 people have died. Even after we produce a vaccine, experts say that it could be months or even years before we come back to anything approaching normal. My question for both of you is, based on what you have said and done so far, and what you have said you would do starting in 2021, why should the American people trust you more than your opponent to deal with this public health crisis going forward? In this case, the question goes to you first, sir. Two minutes, uninterrupted.

Vice President Joe Biden:
Good luck. 200,000 dead. As you said, over seven million infected in the United States. We, in fact, have 4% of the world's population, 20% of the deaths. 40,000 people a day are contracting COVID. In addition to that, about between 750 and 1000 people a day are dying. When he was presented with that number, he said, "It is what it is." Well, it is what it is because you are who you are. That's why it is. The President has no plan. He hasn't laid out anything. He knew all the way back in February how serious this crisis was. He knew it was a deadly disease. What did he do? He's on tape as acknowledging he knew it. He said he didn't tell us or give people a warning of it because he didn't want to panic the American people. You don't panic. He panicked. In addition to that, what did he do?

Vice President Joe Biden:
He went in and we were insisting that the people we had in the ground in China should be able to go to Wuhan and determine for themselves how dangerous this was. He did not even ask Xi to do that.

President Donald J. Trump:
Wrong.

Vice President Joe Biden:
He told us what a great job Xi was doing. He said we owe him debt of gratitude for being so transparent with us. And what did he do then? He then did nothing. He waited and waited and waited. He still doesn't have a plan.

President Donald J. Trump:
Wrong.

Chris Wallace:
Sir, it's his two minutes.

President Donald J. Trump:
It's so wrong.

Vice President Joe Biden:
I laid out back in March, exactly what we should be doing. And I laid out again in July, what we should be doing. We should be providing all the protective gear possible. We should be providing the money the House has passed in order to be able to go out and get people the help they need to keep their businesses open. Open schools cost a lot of money. You should get out of your bunker and get out of the sand trap in your golf course and go in the Oval Office and bring together the Democrats and Republicans and fund what needs to be done now to save lives.

President Donald J. Trump:
So, if we would have listened to you.

Chris Wallace:
Wait, wait. You have two minutes, sir.

President Donald J. Trump:
If we would've listened to you, the country would have been left wide open, millions of people would have died, not 200,000. And one person is too much. It's China's fault. It should have never happened. They stopped it from going in, but it was China's fault. And, by the way, when you talk about numbers, you don't know how many people died in China. You don't know how many people died in Russia. You don't know how many people died in India. They don't exactly give you a straight count, just so you understand. But if you look at what we've done, I closed it and you said, "He's xenophobic. He's a racist and he's xenophobic," because you didn't think I should have closed our country. Wait a minute.

Chris Wallace:
Sir, it's his two minutes.

President Donald J. Trump:
You didn't think we should have closed our country because you thought it was terrible. You wouldn't have closed it for another two months. By my doing it early, in fact, Dr. Fauci said, "President Trump saved thousands of lives." Many of your Democrat Governors said, "President Trump did a phenomenal job." We worked with the Governor. Oh really, go take a look. The Governors said I did a phenomenal job. Most of them said that. In fact, people that would not be necessarily on my side said that, "President Trump did a phenomenal job." We did. We got the gowns. We got the masks. We made the ventilators. You wouldn't have made ventilators. And now we're weeks away from a vaccine. We're doing therapeutics already. Fewer people are dying when they get sick. Far fewer people are dying. We've done a great job.

President Donald J. Trump:
The only thing I haven't done a good job, and that's because of the fake news, no matter what you say to them, they give you a bad press on it. It's just fake news. They give you good press, they give me bad press because that's the way it is, unfortunately. But let me just say something. I don't care. I've gotten used to it. But I'll tell you, Joe, you could never have done the job that we did. You don't have it in your blood. You could've never done that, Joe.

Vice President Joe Biden:
I know how to do the job. I know how to get the job done.

President Donald J. Trump:
Well, you didn't do very well in Swine Flu. H1-N1, you were a disaster. Your own Chief of Staff said you were a disaster.

Vice President Joe Biden:
14,000 people died, not 200,000.

President Donald J. Trump:
A far less lethal disease, by the way.

Chris Wallace:
Sir, you made a point. Let him answer it.

Vice President Joe Biden:
And there was no one ... We didn't shut down the economy. This is his economy he shut down. The reason it's shut down is because, look, you folks at home. How many of you got up this morning and had an empty chair at the kitchen table because someone died of COVID? How many of you are in a situation where you lost your mom or dad and you couldn't even speak to them, you had a nurse holding a phone up so you could in fact say goodbye?

President Donald J. Trump:
We would have lost far more people, far more people. You would have been months late. You're months behind me, Joe.

Vice President Joe Biden:
His own CDC Director says we could lose as many as another 200,000 people between now and the end of the year. And he said, if we just wear a mask, we can save half those numbers. Just a mask. And by the way, in terms of the whole notion of a vaccine, we're for a vaccine, but I don't trust him at all. Nor do you. I know you don't. What we trust is a scientist.

President Donald J. Trump:
You don't trust Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer?

Chris Wallace:
Okay, gentlemen, gentlemen. Let me move on to questions about the future because you both have touched on two of the questions I'm going to ask. Focusing on the future first, President Trump, you have repeatedly either contradicted or been at odds with some of your governments own top scientists. The week before last, the Head of the Centers for Disease Control, Dr. Redfield said it would be summer before the vaccine would become generally available to the public. You said that he was confused and mistaken. Those were your two words.
