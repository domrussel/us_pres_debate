# A Textual Analysis of all U.S. General Election Debates

This repository constructs a series of analyses that explore the text of every presidential debate.

<span style="font-size:6em;">You can find the write-up hosted [here](https://github.com/domrussel/us_pres_debate).</span>

The debate responses are scraped from the [Commission on Presidential Debates](https://www.debates.org/voter-education/debate-transcripts/) (for 1960 to 2016) and from rev.com (for 2020).

The cleaned data with text by speaker are available in the file `output/all_debate_text.csv`.

All analyses do not include the presidential debate scheduled for October 22, 2020.

Suggestions, questions, comments, and pull requests are welcome! Please submit an issue or email domrussel \[at\] gmail dot com.
